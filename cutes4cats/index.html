            <h1>Bright Side of Cats</h1>
            <p>There are too many in the world missing out on the fun that is known as having cats. Simply, they are beautiful creatures that care very much for their vanity. And, they are different from dogs! While Dogs require extra care and a lot more walks, Cats are happy to lay about. That is the joy of having our feline friends, and that is why I wish to present to the people the utter adorableness of the feline friends, which all come from different places.</p>
            <p>In this site, I have split two sections dedicated for the age of the cat pictures I will show, which can range from adorable to lovable. The "Adult" section for the cats is where I will put about pictures of adult cats, which may look more refined and more sure of themselves. These pictures may be more for aesthetic purposes rather than outright adorable cuteness. Now, in the "Kittens" section, one would be able to see the adorable little fluffballs as they are at a younger age. This is for those looking to say "aww" to the cute kitten photos.</p>
