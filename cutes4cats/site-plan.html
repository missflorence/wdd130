      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Many people would usually look for hobbies or other fun activities to brighten their day. But, in some cases, pictures of adorable cats or dogs are enough to cheer you up, no matter what time of day it is. It’s why I seek to create a website just for that purpose! A place where you can browse through some of the most adorable pet pictures alongside their source! Wouldn’t you want that? A place meant to look at cat and dog pictures without the distraction of ads or any other media? A website you can visit for the very purpose of cheering you up? That’s the website I aim to create.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Nobody is too old for cat pictures! Why else would young children squeal at the cutest animals? And no matter what age, cats would always be adorable to anyone, from the youngest toddler, to the oldest of grandmothers and grandfathers. The audience for showing cute cat pictures are plentiful!</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        There are too many in the world missing out on the fun that is known as having cats. Simply, they are beautiful creatures that care very much for their vanity.
        And, they are different from dogs! While Dogs require extra care and a lot more walks, Cats are happy to lay about.
        That is the joy of having our feline friends, and that is why I wish to present to the people the utter adorableness of the feline friends,
        which all come from different places.</p>
       <p>
        In this site, I have split two sections dedicated for the age of the cat pictures I will show, which can range from adorable to lovable. The "Adult"
        section for the cats is where I will put about pictures of adult cats, which may look more refined and more sure of themselves. These pictures may be more
        for aesthetic purposes rather than outright adorable cuteness. Now, in the "Kittens" section, one would be able to see the adorable little fluffballs as they are
        at a younger age. This is for those looking to say "aww" to the cute kitten photos.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="images/cutekitten.jpeg" alt="image for homepage">
        <img src="images/cutekitten2.jpeg" alt="image for homepage">

      </ul>
      <h3>Adult</h3>
      <p>
        They say that a cat has 9 lives, and these felines most certainly do look the part. Yes, there are some remnants of their youth in these
        photographs, but these are cats that now know their purpose in life, whether dedicating it to eating delicious wet food that they enjoy, or
        snoozing through the day at hours at a time. We may love cats for their simplicity, but even they have their own complex set of needs and wants,
        much like us, humans do as well. </p>

        <p>So, depending on how one raised their cat, they may see different sides that they have never thought to expect from their feline companions at all.
        Some are more demanding than others when it comes to their food. Some don't like the companion of dogs. There are even some that don't like the companion
        of anyone else aside from the one that cares for them. Part of the fun is looking through a part of these cats' personalities through a picture, and trying
        to guess what kind of cat they may be.

      </ul>
      <h3>Kittens</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike their older counterparts, kittens are less than sure of their footing in the world. Most kittens aren't even half a year old, and that is why
        the focus on their small size is the key, as they can sneak around in corners one wouldn't suspect. For now, until they turn into adult cats, they have this
        playful energy, depending on their mood, of course. These kittens learn through play more than anything, and at this age, demand quite a lot of attention.</p>

        <p>They are almost like human toddlers in a way, where they are able to process information and take it into their own hands. These kitten pictures may fit well into either
        two categories; one, where these kittens are in a playful mood, or two, when they are in a more calmer mood that they usually are. It's never easy to photograph a fidgety kitten,
        but in the right conditions, their human companions are able to photograph them just in the right moment; just before they are about to play!
