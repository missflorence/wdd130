    <p>Hi guys! I'm very pleased to meet you all. I'm not currently married,
        but I am dating someone that I think could be the one. It's a new relationship,
        and we're still working things out. I'm from the Laguna, Philippines, but I am
        currently in the states visiting my relatives I haven't caught up onto for a while.
    </p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church for practically all my life, as I have been
        born of the covenant, as my parents say. I love the community and closeness
        surrounding this church, and the love and support that many brothers and
        sisters are willing to give to me.
    </p>
    <p>Currently, I don't really have a job, as I am a full-time student, but I am
        persuing an Applied Technology degree, and I hope that I'll be able to learn
        as much as I can with this class, which I can apply not only for my degree,
        but also for the real world.

    </p>
